Description: Provides functions to have visualization and clean-up of enriched gene ontologies (GO) terms, 
    protein complexes and pathways (obtained from multiple databases) using 'ConsensusPathDB' 
    from gene set over-expression analysis. Performs clustering of pathway based on similarity 
    of over-expressed gene sets and visualizations similar to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) 
    when up and down regulated genes are known. The methods are described in a paper currently
    submitted by Orecchioni et al, 2020 in Nanoscale.
